# Phase 5: API Endpoints (Mocked) - Blueprint
# Requirements and objectives for implementing API contracts with mocks

phase_info:
  id: 5
  name: "API Endpoints (Mocked)"
  purpose: "Implement API contracts with mocks"
  dependencies: ["phase_4", "phase_1"]
  
objectives:
  primary:
    - "Implement all OpenAPI endpoints with realistic mocks"
    - "Validate request/response schemas"
    - "Test API contract compliance"
    - "Establish endpoint patterns and conventions"
  secondary:
    - "Create mock data generators"
    - "Implement rate limiting middleware"
    - "Add comprehensive input validation"
    
requirements:
  endpoint_implementation:
    thread_management:
      - "POST /threads - Create thread with mock Discord ID"
      - "GET /threads/{id} - Return thread metadata"
      - "GET /threads - List threads (optional for MVP)"
    message_handling:
      - "POST /threads/{id}/messages - Post message with mock response"
      - "GET /threads/{id}/messages - Return paginated message list"
    authentication:
      - "All endpoints require valid API key"
      - "Return 401 for missing/invalid authentication"
      
  mock_behavior:
    realistic_responses:
      - "Generate Discord-like IDs (snowflake format)"
      - "Return proper timestamps and metadata"
      - "Simulate message attribution data"
    error_simulation:
      - "Return 404 for non-existent threads/messages"
      - "Return 400 for invalid request schemas"
      - "Return 429 for rate limit violations"
    data_consistency:
      - "Mock data persists within request session"
      - "Thread/message relationships maintained"
      
deliverables:
  - "Complete API endpoint implementations with mocks"
  - "Request/response validation using Pydantic models"
  - "Mock data generation utilities"
  - "Rate limiting middleware implementation"
  - "Comprehensive error handling for all endpoints"
  
validation_criteria:
  - "All OpenAPI endpoints respond correctly"
  - "Request/response schemas match OpenAPI specification"
  - "Authentication works across all protected endpoints"
  - "Error responses follow established patterns"
  - "Rate limiting returns appropriate 429 responses"
