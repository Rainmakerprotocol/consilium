# Phase 1: System Contracts & API Design - Blueprint
# Requirements and objectives for API contract definition

phase_info:
  id: 1
  name: "System Contracts & API Design"
  purpose: "Define API contracts as source of truth"
  dependencies: ["phase_0"]
  
objectives:
  primary:
    - "Refine and validate OpenAPI specification"
    - "Define all request/response schemas"
    - "Establish API versioning strategy"
    - "Document authentication requirements"
  secondary:
    - "Plan error handling patterns"
    - "Design rate limiting specifications"
    - "Define message attribution schemas"
    
requirements:
  functional:
    thread_management:
      - "Create Discord threads via API"
      - "Support thread title and initial message"
      - "Return thread ID and Discord URL"
    message_handling:
      - "Post messages to existing threads"
      - "Support message splitting for >2000 characters"
      - "Include agent attribution metadata"
    data_retrieval:
      - "Fetch message history from threads"
      - "Support pagination and filtering"
      - "Include attribution data in responses"
      
  non_functional:
    performance:
      - "API response time <200ms p95"
      - "Support concurrent requests from multiple AI agents"
    reliability:
      - "Graceful error handling and recovery"
      - "Rate limiting to prevent Discord API violations"
    security:
      - "API key authentication for all endpoints"
      - "Input validation and sanitization"
      
deliverables:
  - "Refined OpenAPI specification (consilium-openapi-v1.2.yaml)"
  - "API contract validation documentation"
  - "Request/response schema definitions"
  - "Authentication and authorization specifications"
  
validation_criteria:
  - "OpenAPI schema validates successfully"
  - "All endpoints have complete request/response definitions"
  - "Authentication requirements clearly specified"
  - "Error response schemas defined for all endpoints"
