# Requirements and objectives for MVP-ready containerization

phase_info:
  id: 8
  name: "Simple Containerization"
  purpose: "MVP-ready containerization"
  dependencies: ["phase_4", "phase_5", "phase_6", "phase_7"]
  
objectives:
  primary:
    - "Create production-ready Dockerfile"
    - "Configure container for deployment platforms"
    - "Implement proper secrets management"
    - "Optimize container size and startup time"
  secondary:
    - "Add health checks and monitoring"
    - "Configure logging for container environments"
    - "Create docker-compose for local development"
    
requirements:
  dockerfile:
    base_image:
      - "python:3.11-slim for minimal size"
      - "Multi-stage build for dependency optimization"
    application_setup:
      - "Copy application code and install dependencies"
      - "Create non-root user for security"
      - "Set proper working directory and permissions"
    runtime_configuration:
      - "Expose port 8000 for FastAPI application"
      - "Set PYTHONPATH and other environment variables"
      - "Configure proper signal handling for graceful shutdown"
      
  container_optimization:
    size_reduction:
      - "Multi-stage build to exclude build dependencies"
      - "Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files"
      - "Minimize layers and combine RUN commands"
    performance:
      - "Pre-compile Python bytecode"
      - "Optimize startup time with proper dependency ordering"
      
  deployment_configuration:
    environment_variables:
      - "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN for Discord authentication"
      - "API_KEY for service authentication"
      - "LOG_LEVEL for logging configuration"
      - "PORT for dynamic port binding (Railway/Fly.io)"
    health_checks:
      - "HTTP health check endpoint at /health"
      - "Container health check configuration"
      
deliverables:
  - "Production-ready Dockerfile with multi-stage build"
  - "Docker-compose configuration for local development"
  - "Environment variable documentation"
  - "Container health check implementation"
  - "Deployment configuration for Railway.app/Fly.io"
  
validation_criteria:
  - "Container builds successfully"
  - "Application starts and responds to health checks"
  - "Container size optimized (<200MB)"
  - "Environment variables properly configured"
  - "Container runs successfully on target platforms"
