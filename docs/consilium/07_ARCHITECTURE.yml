  id: 7
  name: "Essential Testing"
  focus: "Testing architecture and quality assurance framework"
  
architectural_decisions:
  testing_strategy:
    test_pyramid:
      - "Unit tests: 70% - Fast, isolated, comprehensive coverage"
      - "Integration tests: 20% - Service boundary validation"
      - "End-to-end tests: 10% - Critical workflow validation"
    testing_philosophy:
      - "Test behavior, not implementation details"
      - "Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for test structure"
      - "Fail-fast approach with clear error messages"
      
  test_infrastructure:
    framework_architecture:
      - "pytest as primary testing framework"
      - "pytest-asyncio for async test support"
      - "unittest.mock for dependency isolation"
    fixture_design:
      - "Hierarchical fixtures for setup reuse"
      - "Scope-appropriate fixture lifetimes"
      - "Test data factories for realistic data generation"
      
  mock_strategy:
    external_dependency_mocking:
      - "Mock Discord API calls with realistic responses"
      - "Mock FastAPI dependencies for isolated testing"
      - "Mock database operations (if added in future)"
    mock_patterns:
      - "Behavioral mocking for interaction verification"
      - "Return value mocking for happy path testing"
      - "Exception mocking for error scenario testing"
      
technical_specifications:
  test_organization:
    directory_structure:
      - "tests/ directory mirroring src/ structure"
      - "test_*.py naming convention for test discovery"
      - "conftest.py for shared fixtures and configuration"
    test_categories:
      unit_tests:
        - "tests/test_api/ - API endpoint testing"
        - "tests/test_discord/ - Discord client testing"
        - "tests/test_core/ - Core utility testing"
      integration_tests:
        - "tests/integration/ - Cross-service testing"
        - "tests/contract/ - API contract validation"
      
  coverage_requirements:
    coverage_targets:
      - "Overall project coverage: 80% minimum"
      - "Critical path coverage: 100% (auth, rate limiting)"
      - "New code coverage: 90% for all new features"
    coverage_reporting:
      - "HTML coverage reports for detailed analysis"
      - "Coverage badge integration for visibility"
      - "Coverage tracking in CI/CD pipeline"
      
  test_data_management:
    test_data_strategy:
      - "Factory pattern for test data generation"
      - "Parameterized tests for multiple scenario coverage"
      - "Realistic test data that mirrors production patterns"
    test_isolation:
      - "Independent test execution without shared state"
      - "Database/state cleanup between test runs"
      - "Parallel test execution safety"
      
  continuous_integration:
    ci_pipeline:
      - "Automated test execution on all pull requests"
      - "Test result reporting with detailed failure information"
      - "Performance regression detection"
    quality_gates:
      - "All tests must pass before merge"
      - "Coverage threshold enforcement"
      - "Code quality checks (linting, type checking)"
