  name: "Discord Infrastructure"
  focus: "Discord API integration patterns and bot architecture"
  
architectural_decisions:
  bot_architecture:
    connection_pattern:
      - "Single persistent connection to Discord Gateway"
      - "Event-driven architecture for Discord events"
      - "Graceful reconnection handling with exponential backoff"
    permission_model:
      - "Principle of least privilege for bot permissions"
      - "Server-specific permissions rather than global"
      - "Channel-level permission validation"
      
  discord_api_integration:
    client_configuration:
      - "discord.py Client with specific intents"
      - "Message content intent for content processing"
      - "Guild messages intent for thread management"
    rate_limiting_strategy:
      - "Built-in discord.py rate limiting respect"
      - "Additional application-level throttling"
      - "Queue management for burst traffic"
      
  thread_management:
    thread_lifecycle:
      - "Create threads in designated parent channel"
      - "Thread naming convention with timestamps"
      - "Thread metadata storage for API mapping"
    message_handling:
      - "Embed-based message attribution"
      - "Message splitting for content >2000 characters"
      - "Markdown preservation across splits"
      
technical_specifications:
  bot_configuration:
    required_intents:
      - "GUILDS - For server and channel access"
      - "GUILD_MESSAGES - For message operations"
      - "MESSAGE_CONTENT - For content processing"
    required_permissions:
      - "VIEW_CHANNEL - Read channel information"
      - "SEND_MESSAGES - Post messages to channels/threads"
      - "CREATE_PUBLIC_THREADS - Create new discussion threads"
      - "SEND_MESSAGES_IN_THREADS - Post in created threads"
      - "READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY - Fetch conversation history"
      
  connection_management:
    initialization_sequence:
      - "Load bot token from secure environment variable"
      - "Initialize client with required intents"
      - "Validate bot permissions in target guild"
      - "Register event handlers for connection monitoring"
    error_handling:
      - "Connection loss detection and automatic reconnection"
      - "Rate limit error handling with backoff"
      - "Permission error detection and reporting"
      
  validation_procedures:
    connectivity_tests:
      - "Bot login and guild connection validation"
      - "Permission verification in target channels"
      - "Basic operation tests (send message, create thread)"
    monitoring_setup:
      - "Connection status logging"
      - "API usage metrics collection"
      - "Error rate monitoring and alerting"
