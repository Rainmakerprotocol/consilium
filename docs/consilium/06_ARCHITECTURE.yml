# Phase 6: Discord Integration - Architecture
# Technical design for Discord API integration replacing mocks

phase_info:
  id: 6
  name: "Discord Integration"
  focus: "Discord client integration and real-time message handling"
  
architectural_decisions:
  discord_client_architecture:
    connection_management:
      - "Singleton Discord client instance with connection pooling"
      - "Persistent gateway connection with automatic reconnection"
      - "Event loop integration with FastAPI async context"
    client_lifecycle:
      - "Client initialization during FastAPI startup"
      - "Graceful shutdown during application termination"
      - "Connection health monitoring and status reporting"
      
  message_attribution_system:
    embed_design:
      - "Discord embeds for message attribution metadata"
      - "Footer-based attribution to preserve message content"
      - "Consistent formatting across all AI agents"
    metadata_structure:
      - "Agent name, model identifier, and run ID inclusion"
      - "Timestamp preservation from original message creation"
      - "Color coding by agent type for visual distinction"
      
  rate_limiting_integration:
    discord_compliance:
      - "Respect discord.py built-in rate limiting"
      - "Additional application-level throttling for safety margin"
      - "Queue management for burst request scenarios"
    token_bucket_implementation:
      - "Per-endpoint rate limiting with separate buckets"
      - "Configurable limits based on Discord API specifications"
      - "Graceful handling with 202 Accepted responses"
      
technical_specifications:
  discord_operations:
    thread_creation:
      - "Use discord.py TextChannel.create_thread() method"
      - "Handle thread creation permissions and errors"
      - "Return Discord thread ID and URL for API responses"
    message_posting:
      - "Use discord.py Thread.send() with embed attribution"
      - "Implement message splitting for >2000 character content"
      - "Preserve markdown formatting across message splits"
    message_retrieval:
      - "Use discord.py Thread.history() for message fetching"
      - "Parse embed attribution data from historical messages"
      - "Implement pagination with Discord's message iteration"
      
  error_handling_patterns:
    discord_api_errors:
      - "Handle rate limiting (429) with exponential backoff"
      - "Manage permission errors (403) with descriptive messages"
      - "Process connection errors with retry mechanisms"
    application_error_mapping:
      - "Map Discord errors to appropriate HTTP status codes"
      - "Provide detailed error messages for client debugging"
      - "Log Discord API errors with correlation IDs"
      
  performance_optimization:
    connection_efficiency:
      - "Connection pooling for multiple concurrent requests"
      - "Batch operations where possible to reduce API calls"
      - "Cache frequently accessed data (channel/thread metadata)"
    resource_management:
      - "Proper async context management for Discord operations"
      - "Memory-efficient message processing for large threads"
      - "Garbage collection of unused Discord objects"
