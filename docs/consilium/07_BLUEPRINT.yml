phase_info:
  id: 7
  name: "Essential Testing"
  purpose: "MVP-focused testing strategy"
  dependencies: ["phase_5", "phase_6"]
  
objectives:
  primary:
    - "Achieve 80%+ test coverage on core functionality"
    - "Create integration tests for Discord workflows"
    - "Implement API contract testing"
    - "Set up automated test execution"
  secondary:
    - "Add performance testing for rate limiting"
    - "Create test utilities and fixtures"
    - "Document testing procedures"
    
requirements:
  test_coverage:
    unit_tests:
      - "Test all API endpoints with mocked dependencies"
      - "Test Discord client operations with mock responses"
      - "Test rate limiting logic and token bucket behavior"
      - "Test message attribution and splitting functionality"
    integration_tests:
      - "Test complete API workflows with real Discord (test server)"
      - "Test error handling and recovery scenarios"
      - "Test authentication and authorization flows"
    contract_tests:
      - "Validate API responses against OpenAPI schema"
      - "Test request validation for all endpoints"
      
  testing_infrastructure:
    framework_setup:
      - "pytest with asyncio support for async testing"
      - "Mock framework for external dependencies"
      - "Test fixtures for common test data"
    test_environment:
      - "Separate Discord test server/channel"
      - "Test API keys and configuration"
      - "Isolated test database/state if needed"
      
  quality_gates:
    coverage_requirements:
      - "Minimum 80% line coverage overall"
      - "100% coverage on critical paths (authentication, rate limiting)"
    test_execution:
      - "All tests pass in CI environment"
      - "Tests run in under 30 seconds for fast feedback"
      
deliverables:
  - "Comprehensive test suite with 80%+ coverage"
  - "Integration tests for Discord workflows"
  - "API contract validation tests"
  - "Test fixtures and utilities"
  - "CI configuration for automated testing"
  
validation_criteria:
  - "Test coverage meets 80% minimum threshold"
  - "All tests pass consistently"
  - "Integration tests validate real Discord operations"
  - "API contract tests prevent regression"
  - "Test execution time remains under 30 seconds"
