CONSILIUM RELAY - PHASE PROGRESS NOTES
======================================

Phase 0: Foundation & AI Orientation - COMPLETED
- ✓ All 7 foundation YAML documents created
- ✓ Project mission and MVP definition established
- ✓ AI agent rules and coding standards defined
- ✓ Technical constraints and architecture decisions documented
- ✓ Multi-AI collaboration patterns specified
- ✓ Phase progression roadmap created
- ✓ Validation framework and quality gates defined
- ✓ Copilot instructions and automation rules established

Key Context for AI Agents:
- Single-user MVP focused on Chairman + Claude + ChatGPT collaboration
- Discord as message board, FastAPI as relay service
- Python 3.11, async-first architecture, stateless design
- OpenAPI schema as source of truth for implementation
- Token bucket rate limiting for Discord API compliance
- Message attribution via Discord embed footers
- 9-phase progression with clear dependencies and validation

Next Phase: Phase 1 - System Contracts & API Design
Dependencies: Phase 0 complete ✓
Objective: Define API contracts as source of truth
Deliverables: 01_BLUEPRINT.yml, 01_ARCHITECTURE.yml, 01_IMPLEMENTATION.yml

IMPORTANT NOTES FOR AI AGENTS:
1. Always read Phase 0 documents before code generation
2. Reference OpenAPI schema as authoritative source
3. Follow dependency graph in 00_PHASE_PROGRESSION.yml
4. Validate completion criteria before phase transitions
5. Update this file with progress and key decisions
6. Use TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.yml for architectural choices

MVP Success Criteria:
- Multi-AI conversation flows through Discord successfully
- Message attribution works correctly for all agents
- Rate limiting prevents Discord API violations
- System handles typical conversation loads reliably
- Chairman can observe and participate in AI discussions
